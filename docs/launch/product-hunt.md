## Maker's First Comment

Hey Product Hunt! I'm Manuk, the maker of Relaticle.

I built Relaticle because I was frustrated with CRMs that couldn't talk to AI agents. HubSpot has 9 MCP tools. Salesforce is adding Agentforce. But if you want an open-source, self-hosted CRM that your AI agents can actually operate — nothing existed.

So I built one.

Relaticle ships with a production MCP server (20 tools), a REST API, and 22 custom field types. Your AI agent can create contacts, update deals, log notes, and query CRM data — all through the standard MCP protocol.

The entire thing is AGPL-3.0 open source. No per-seat pricing. Deploy it on your infrastructure or use our managed hosting at app.relaticle.com.

I'd love to hear what you think. What would you want an AI agent to do with your CRM?
