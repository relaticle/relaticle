### 1/8 — Hook
I built an open-source CRM with 20 MCP tools so AI agents can manage your customer data.

HubSpot has 9. Salesforce is still figuring it out. Relaticle ships 20 today.

Here's what it does and why it matters:

### 2/8 — The Problem
Every CRM was built for humans clicking buttons.

But AI agents don't click buttons. They need APIs. They need structured schemas. They need tools.

Most CRMs bolt on AI features as an afterthought. We built ours agent-native from day one.

### 3/8 — What's Agent-Native Mean?
Agent-native = MCP server and REST API are first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.

Your AI agent can:
- Create and update contacts, companies, deals
- Log notes and create tasks
- Query data with filters and sorting
- Discover your custom field schema

All through standard MCP protocol.

### 4/8 — The Numbers
- 20 MCP tools (full CRUD for 5 entity types)
- 22 custom field types (no code, no migrations)
- REST API with JSON:API format
- 900+ automated tests
- 5-layer authorization with multi-team isolation

### 5/8 — Self-Hosted & Open Source
AGPL-3.0. Deploy on your infrastructure.

No per-seat pricing that scales badly.
No data leaving your servers.
No vendor deciding your AI strategy.

Your CRM. Your data. Your agents.

### 6/8 — The Stack
Built with modern tools:
- Laravel 12 + PHP 8.4
- Filament 5 for the admin UI
- PostgreSQL 17
- Livewire 4 for reactivity

Not a weekend project. Production-grade with 900+ tests.

### 7/8 — Who's This For?
- Developer-led teams who want AI in their CRM
- Startups tired of paying per-seat for HubSpot
- Companies that need self-hosted for compliance
- Anyone building AI workflows that touch customer data
