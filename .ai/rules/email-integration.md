# Email integration

## Never import provider drafts

Gmail drafts carry the `DRAFT` label and not `SENT`, so `fetchMessage()` classifies
them as inbound. `StoreEmailJob` skips `EmailFolder::Drafts` before the inbox/sent
toggle, and Gmail backfill lists with `-in:drafts`. Importing a draft would store it
as `SYNCED` with the account's sharing default, so teammates could read unsent mail
through linked CRM records. Composer drafts (`EmailStatus::DRAFT`) are a different
path and stay local.

## Privacy-aware email search

Mailbox search (inbox and record email pages) must go through
`EmailSearchService`. Never `ilike` on `subject` or `snippet` alone.
Metadata-only teammate rows stay in the list, but those columns are hidden.
A guessed subject must not match. Participants remain searchable.

## Meeting attendee "self"

`MeetingAttendee.is_self` is the mailbox that owns that meeting copy, not the
current viewer. Name that row from `meeting.connectedAccount.user` (or the
account display name). Never substitute `auth()->user()`. Alice viewing
Bob's copy must still show Bob.
